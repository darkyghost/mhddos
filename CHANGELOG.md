- **21.05.2022**
  - Added english localization - use flag `--lang EN` (more languages may be added later)

- **18.05.2022**
  - Added `--copies` option in order to run multiple copies (recommended for use with 4+ CPUs and network > 100 Mb / s).

- **15.05.2022**
  - Completely updated, asynchronous version, which ensures maximum efficiency and minimum load on the system
  - Efficient operation with larger values of the `-t` parameter (up to 10k) without the risk of "freezing" the whole system
  - A brand-new algorithm for load balancing between targets in order to achieve maximum attack efficiency
  - Attack types `RGET`, `RHEAD`, `RHEX` and `STOMP` added

- **23.04.2022** 
  - The `--vpn` option has been changed - now your IP/VPN is being used **together** with the proxy, rather than instead. To restore the previous behavior, use `--vpn 100`
- **20.04.2022**
  - Significantly improved the system resources utilization for the best attack efficiency
  - Added `--udp-threads` option in order to control the intensity of UDP attacks (default 1)
- **18.04.2022** 
  - In the `--debug` mode, total statistics for all targets have been added
  - More proxy servers have been added
- **13.04.2022** 
  - Added the option to disable targets and add comments to the configuration file; now lines starting with '#' are ignored
  - Fixed an issue of crashing the script after a long run and other bugs while changing loops
  - Fixed color display on Windows terminal (without editing the registry)
  - In case of no targets available, the script will wait, instead of stopping completely
- **09.04.2022** New proxy utilization system; as of now everyone gets ~ 200 proxies to attack from a total pool of 10,000+. The `-p` (` --period`) and `--proxy-timeout` parameters are deprecated
- **04.04.2022** Added the ability to use your own proxy list for the attack: [instructions] (#custom-proxies)
- **03.04.2022** Fixed 'Too many open files' bug (thanks to @kobzar-darmogray and @euclid-catoptrics)
- **02.04.2022** Working threads are being reused rather than restarted for each cycle. Ctrl-C has also been fixed
- **01.04.2022** Updated CFB attack method to synchronize with MHDDoS
- **31.03.2022** Added some reliable DNS servers instead of system ones for name resolution (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8 etc.)
- **29.03.2022** Added support for the local configuration file (thanks to @kobzar-darmogray)
- **28.03.2022** Table output implemented `--table` (thanks to @alexneo2003)
- **27.03.2022**
    - Implemented DBG, BOMB (thanks to @drew-kun for PR), and KILLER methods to synchronize with the original MHDDoS
- **26.03.2022**
    - Launch a number of selected attacks instead of random ones
    - Reduced RAM utilization on a large number of targets; now only the `-t` parameter affects RAM
    - Added DNS caching and correct handling of resolving problems
- **25.03.2022** Added VPN mode instead of proxy (`--vpn` flag)
- **25.03.2022** 
  - MHDDoS has been put in the repository for overall control over development
